# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
);

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined who the Top 5 artists are by popularity.
SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5;

#Then I determined which songs with a popularity of at least 90 also had at least a 0.7 energy level.
SELECT track_name,
popularity,
energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 90 AND energy >= 0.7;
